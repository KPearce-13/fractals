# fractals
Some odd code for representing folding curves. I'm sorry if it's messy or incorrect!
1. `square1.py` is an initial test/proof of concept of coding L-systems with turtle in Python. Edit and run in an IDE, or with `python square1.py`
2. `triangle1.py` is an implementation on the triangular grid. Run as above
3. `triangle2.py` adds the non-turn `0` and uses a simplified input via the command line. Run e.g. `python triangle2.py "+0-" <depth=1> <size=100>` in the command line (`<optional argument=default>`, in this case `rule="F+F0F-F"`)

You may need to install python and related packages such as canvasvg to run this code locally
